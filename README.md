# Alejandra Quintero's Professional Website>

## Description

- What was your motivation?
    My motivation was to create a professional looking website where I could present my work and build my website as I continue on with the course. 

- Why did you build this project? 
    To practice CSS, add styling, using flexboxs and media queries to flex sections on top of each other. This would Also give my page a professional look to it. 

- What problem does it solve?
    It solves the problem of compiling my current skills and projects in a professional way. It is responsive which means that the website can be viewed on multiple different screeen sizes. There are links to my external sites such as linkedin.  

- What did you learn?
    I was able to apply flexbox elements as well as other css elements, I used a new font that I had seen from another website and used Google Fonts to apply it to my website. I also learned about making a navigation bar inherit the color of the elements rather than using default browser settings.

## Credits

I had a tutoring session with Chris Baird to change the color of the naviagtion bar from the presets to the color of the rest of the page. 

I also had help during office hours with Meg Meyers. 

I had problems with my page because I recieved two completely different approaches from the two tutors that saw for help on this page. 

I referenced this website for helping get some of the elements of flexbox:

I used some of the color and used the font from this personal website of a youtuber that I follow:
